### Function in python.

1) In Python we use the function as function defination.

2) A function is a self-contained block of code that encapsulates a specific task or related group of tasks. 

3) Basic syntex of python as follow.

```python
    def functionName(parameters){
        #code inside the python function
    }
```

4) It's not necessery to take more then 1 parameters in the function.
```python
    def functionName(parameter1, parameter2){
        #code inside the python function
    }
```

5) Polymorphism example with python.

```python
    def sum(a, b):
        return a+b;

    print(sum("HEllo", "WOrld"))

    print(sum(3,4))   
```
It mean it can handles the sum of digits and string both.


### Lambda function
---

`Lambda` function's are the function those don't have their any specific name, they are just use as `call and return.`<br>
In simple we can say `A lambda function` is a function which is just initilized in single line of code and used to do some simple problem without wasting the lot of line of code.

`*args` in function definitions in python is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function.

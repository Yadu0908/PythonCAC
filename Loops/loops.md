## Loops in python my approch for all the problems on each problem

### Problem 1: 
#### Que-: Counting the number of positive number on given list.
<details>

   In that problem we just have to iterate toward each element and have to count the number of iteration when our condition return's True.</p>

</details>


### Problem 2:
#### Que-: Sum of element given on the list. 
<details>

   <summary>Click me for solution</summary><p style= "color: #ede04c">
   Simple for loop will be applied and we will add the output of the previous into the next.</p>

</details>


### Problem 4:
#### Que-: Reverse the String. 

<details>

   <summary>Click me for solution</summary><p style= "color: #ede04c">
   Simple make an empty container (String variable), and then add the each iterative element with that container.</p>

</details>

### Problem 5:
#### Que-: Fetching the first non-repeted letter from the given string.

<details>

   <summary>Click me for solution</summary><p style= "color: #ede04c">
   Simple apply a loop whose range should the total letter present on the String, and then use `count()` build in function and check if is equal to 1, in case condition will be True then the break will be apply. </p>

</details>


### Problem 6:
#### Que-: Factorial of a given number with while loop.


<details>

   <summary>Click me for solution</summary><p style= "color: #ede04c">
   Basic `while loop` will be applied and then, we will multiply the previous ouput with the iterative value and at same time decrement the value of iteration.</p>

</details>



### Problem 7:
#### Que-: Taking the input from the user untill they type the number betweeen 1-10.


<details>

   <summary>Click me for solution</summary><p style= "color: #ede04c">
   Use while loop for iterating the statement and it will be applied till user not type the number less then 10.</p>

</details>



### Problem 8:
#### Que-: Checking for a number is it prime number or not.


<details>

   <summary>Click me for solution</summary><p style= "color: #ede04c">
   First we will use `if` statement for checking, Is number is greater then 1 or not. <br>
   Then we will use iteration whose range should in between 2 and (num ** 0.5). <br>
   Then check if number is fully divisible or not.</p>

</details>


### Problem 9:
#### Que-: Find the unique item from the list.


<details>

   <summary>Click me for solution</summary><p style= "color: #ede04c">
   We can use basic `set()` for this problem.</p>

</details>

### Problem 10:
#### Que-: Exponential Backoff Problem:
The waiting time between each retry is multiplied by a factor that increases with each retry.<br>
**For example,** the first retry may wait for 1 second, the second retry may wait for 2 seconds, the third retry may wait for 4 seconds, and so on.
